simple hello world to some programs from the programming assignments we get in college. You can go as wild as possible.


Read the [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to get started and get your pull request in.


## What is Open Source Software ?

Open Source Software is software whose source code is publicly available. 


Anyone and everyone has the right to copy and modify source code that is open-source, thus anyone is free to add / modify features
and help in constantly improving that piece of code.
Open-source technology and open source thinking both benefit programmers and non-programmers.
Open-source philosophy encourages collaboration on a global level. Some of the greatest software of all time is a result of
constant collaboration with some of the most awesome people in the world. 


## Why is it amazing ?

It is important for people new into the world of programming and software development to understand the importance 
of Open Source and giving back to the community. 

No matter what your skill level, Hacktoberfest is an awesome way to get into using the workflow of git and github and undestand how open-source development works. 
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in the Global Community, anyone and everyone is eligible to make contributions and win the t-shirt.
